Clarifying the links between climate and host-pathogen interactions will provide valuable insight into the dynamics, ecology and evolution of infectious diseases and provide direction for effective management of threatened populations. Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by Batrachochytrium fungi, has recently caused declines and extinctions of amphibian populations on several continents. Our central objective is to develop predictive models of chytridiomycosis, based on a clear understanding of how climate impacts the ecology and dynamics of this host-pathogen interaction, and use the models to investigate the potential of alternative disease management tactics.
